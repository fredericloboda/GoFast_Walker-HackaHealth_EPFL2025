# 1. Summary Document / Concept Overview

## 1.1 Purpose
Provide a clear, actionable overview of the GoFast Walker project for design, build, and evaluation during HackaHealth EPFL 2025.

## 1.2 Problem Statement
Christian (73) remains active but has stiff upper body/arms, loss of arm–leg opposition, and reduced automatic gait coordination following a minor stroke and a car accident.

## 1.3 Objectives
- Restore asynchronous/alternating arm swing linked to gait.
- Preserve/improve stability and postural alignment.
- Achieve low-noise (“silence”) operation.
- Deliver a functional prototype within hackathon constraints.

## 1.4 Constraints
- Physiological movement feel (natural arm–leg rhythm).
- Quiet operation (reduced chatter/vibration).
- Feasible with available materials/time.
- Safe integration with existing walker hardware.

## 1.5 Approach (Concept Directions)
- Linear sliding-arm (Delft-like) mechanism to reproduce arm swing.
- Chain/gear-based rotational transmission to couple alternating handles.

## 1.6 Deliverables
- Prototype with transmission “engine,” enclosure, handles, brakes, and 3D-printed link parts.
- Build notes + bill of materials.
- Short user manual (assembly + adjustment).
- Media: photos/videos of operation.

## 1.7 Success Criteria
- Visible arm–leg opposition during assisted walking.
- Subjective improvement in gait naturalness (Christian’s report).
- Stable posture with no induced sway.
- Low perceived noise during indoor use.

## 3. Introduction of the Challenger and Project Definition

### 3.1 Challenger Profile (Corrected)
- Christian, 73 years old, has been living for a long time with the aftereffects of a minor stroke and a car accident, which have gradually worsened.  
- He remains active today.  
- Walking no longer feels natural; his arms and upper body are stiff, his shoulders do not swing in opposition to his hips, and he has lost the habit of coordinating arm–leg movements.  
- As he puts it, he “moves like a slug.”  
- His challenge is to continue physical exercise despite balance loss, supporting both body and brain through aging (senescence rather than senility).  
- The project aims to adapt one of his two walkers to:  
  - convert rotational motion (wheels/transmission) into linear handle motion,  
  - restore oscillatory arm swing to retrain inter-limb coordination, and  
  - ensure stability through guided biomechanics and damping.  
- **Goal:** enable the walker to recreate a more natural gait kinetic pattern (arm–leg opposition, rhythmic alternation) so that Christian can stay active safely.

### 3.2 Challenger’s Needs
- Medical context: cerebellar ataxia pattern (physio guidance emphasizing sumo/judo posture for balance control).  
- Inspiration: Delft master’s thesis “The Arm Swing Rollator: An Experimental Redesign of the Rollator for Improved Safety and Ergonomics.”  
- Silence requirement: low-noise transmission, vibration damping, and quiet contact interfaces to keep the device non-intrusive.

### 3.3 Challenger’s Constraints
- Movement must feel physiological and coordinated (arm–leg opposition, rhythm).  
- Stability must not be compromised by added mechanisms.  
- Noise should be minimized (quiet operation).  
- Must be feasible with available materials and within hackathon time.

## 4. Project Objectives

### 4.1 Main Goal
- Create a rehabilitation device that enables natural, synchronized, and stable walking movement.

### 4.2 Specific Aims
- Asynchronous / alternating movement (left–right arm opposition).  
- Stability and postural alignment under dynamic load.  
- Low noise (“silence”) via reduced mechanical chatter, vibration damping, and quiet contacts.

---

## 5. Minimal Goal
- Enable Christian to remain active using a walker customized to his condition, built from available materials, within the limited hackathon timeframe.

---

## 6. Extended Goals (If Time Allows)
- Improved transmission precision (tolerances, backlash reduction).  
- Adjustable resistance/damping for graded training.  
- Ergonomic handle geometry and angles for posture.  
- Modular, quick-swap components for tuning.  
- Serviceable enclosure (tool-less access).

---

## 7. Brainstorming Phase

### 7.1 Process
- Group divided into three teams, one focusing on the transmission system.

### 7.2 Main Design Directions
- Delft-like arm-swing rollator — sliding-arm, linear-motion mechanism.  
- Bike-type mechanism — chain-based rotational transmission to synchronize alternating arm movements via linkage.

### 7.3 Explored Concepts
- Simplified car-style mechanism  
- *Arc-en-cercle* arm-swing rollator  
- Vertical vs. horizontal (système avec de la mousse) handle orientation  
- Arm-swing rollator concept  
- Bicycle wheel–type mechanism

---

### 8. Main Steps of Implementation
- Build the transmission “engine” in 3D.  
- Design and assemble the transmission box.  
- Modify Handles; integrate brakes.  
- 3D-print connection parts linking the lower and upper walker structures.
