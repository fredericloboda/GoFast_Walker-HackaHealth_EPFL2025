# 02 — Transmission Mechanism

## 1. Objective

The main objective of the transmission system is to ensure **synchronized and opposing movement** between the left and right lever arms of the walker.  
When the user pushes one lever forward, the opposite lever must move backward, reproducing a natural walking rhythm through mechanical coupling.

## 2. Concept Overview

The transmission relies on a **dual-shaft mechanism** where two coaxially aligned shafts rotate in opposite directions — one **clockwise**, the other **counterclockwise**.  
This counter-rotation allows the system to mimic the natural alternation of arm motion while maintaining mechanical balance and stability.

To achieve this, the system employs a **compact oblique-gear transmission**, consisting of:

- **Two parallel coaxial shafts** (left and right)
- **Two pairs of oblique gears** (gears 1–4)
- **One perpendicular intermediate shaft**, rotated **90°** relative to the main shafts

## 3. Transmission Geometry

The mechanical principle is as follows:

1. The **left shaft** is driven directly by the left lever arm.  
2. Its rotation is transmitted to the **intermediate 90° shaft** via the first pair of oblique gears (gears 1 and 2).  
3. The intermediate shaft transfers the motion to the **right shaft** through the second oblique-gear pair (gears 3 and 4).  
4. Due to the crossing geometry, the **right shaft** rotates in the **opposite direction** of the left shaft.  

This arrangement guarantees synchronized, opposite rotation between the handles, with minimal mechanical loss and excellent compactness.

## 4. Structural Integration

All three shafts — left, right, and intermediate — are housed within a **custom transmission box**.  
The box ensures:

- **Precise axial alignment** of both main shafts  
- **Fixed perpendicular positioning** of the intermediate shaft  
- **Prevention of lateral displacement or misalignment** during operation  
- **Smooth torque transmission** under varying user loads  

This enclosure represents the **core of the transmission module** and ensures stable, repeatable kinematics even under daily mechanical stress.

## 5. Output Coupling

To deliver motion to the walker’s functional elements:

- Two **connection tubes** are attached laterally to the left and right shafts.
- Each tube links directly to a **lever arm** operated by the user.
- Arm motion is therefore transferred through the chain of shafts and gears, producing alternating, synchronized mechanical movement.

## 6. Advantages of the Current Design

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Compactness** | Coaxial and perpendicular shaft arrangement minimizes space and allows easy enclosure in a single box. |
| **Synchronized Opposition** | Left and right shafts rotate inversely with perfect phase shift. |
| **Mechanical Simplicity** | Purely mechanical — no electronic or motorized components required. |
| **Reliability** | Gear alignment secured within a rigid frame to prevent drift or vibration. |

## 7. Summary

The **transmission system** forms the functional core of the walker.  
Through its **coaxial dual-shaft and oblique-gear architecture**, it transforms the alternating arm effort of the user into smooth, synchronized opposing motion — achieving a mechanically elegant and compact solution without any electrical assistance.
